#### I am interested in digital game design as an amateur. I have experienced the cryengine engine for a long time and have intermediate knowledge. I also had the chance to experience programs such as Android Studio, 3DS Max, Google Sketchup, Photoshop CC, Adobe Animate, Adobe Fuse, Character Creator 3.

#### P.S : I did not create a repository on github because my digital game prototypes using the Cryengine game engine exceeded the github lfs limit.
